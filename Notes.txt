Add Option in config.properties to edit the default TRAINING_SET / SAMPLE_POOL locations
Example:
TRAINING_SET_LOCATION=MY_SET
In this example we would have a dir 'MY_SET/' which would then contain
MY_SET
--GJF
--WFN
--AIMALL

Advantage is we could do something like
TRAINING_SET_LOCATION=
OR
TRAINING_SET_LOCATION=cwd
which then would mean you use the directory you're currently in to run ICHOR (current directory contains your GJF/WFN/AIMALL directories)
