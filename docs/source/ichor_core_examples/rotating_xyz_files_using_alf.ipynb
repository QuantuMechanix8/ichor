    "It is useful to rotate the geometries in an xyz file on a particular ALF because this centers all geometries in a dataset on a particular set of atoms. Then you can visually compare datasets to see how the atoms are moving. The ALF contains a central atom, x-axis atom, and xy-plane atom. After calculating the ALF features and converting back into Cartesian coordinates, the central atom is always as the origin (0,0,0), the x-axis atom is moving only along the x-axis (only the x component is changing for all geometries), and the xy-plane atom is only moving in the xy plane (only the x and y components are changing for all geometries)."
