The implementation for the ORCA output file is identical, however there will be additional attributes that need to be defined (which will be the outputs of the calculation). Use the code below (or look at other implementations in ichor) as a reference to define new file formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several important things to note for file reading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You must subclass from `ReadFile`, `WriteFile`, or both. This will allow you to use ichor's lazy file reading and other functionality implemented for files.\n",
    "2. The `HasAtoms` class means that the `atoms` attribute is present in the class. This `atoms` attribute is an instance of `ichor.core.atoms.Atoms` class, which implements all the functionalities for calculating features, defining ALF, etc. If the atomic coordinates are found in the file somewhere, make sure to subclass from `HasAtoms` as well to utilize this functionality.\n",
    "3. In the `__init__` method parameters, make sure any parameters that are going to be read from the file (or are going to be defined by the user) are set as `None`. Then, inside the `__init__` method, use definitions like this `self.charge: int = charge or FileContents`. What this allows you to do is to either give ORCA job options yourself (so these are going to be used, regardless of the definitions in an already present file ORCA input file) or if definitions are left as `None`, then options defined in the already present ORCA file will be read. If the ORCA input file is not present on disk, then sensible default options will be written out to the file.\n",
    "4. You must set the `filetype` method, which returns the extension of the file. This is used to determine the file type in other parts of the ichor code.\n",
    "5. Use the `_set_write_defaults_if_needed` method to set the defaults which are going to be used if writing a new file.\n",
    "6. Implement the `_read_file` and `_write_file` methods which read and write the file respectively. These definitions depend if the file is intended to be read only, written only, or both. Note that the `ichor.core.files.file.File` class implements the `read` and `write` methods, which can be used directly for reading and writing files instead. Note that you will likely not need to use `read` method directly, as accessing any attribute (which contains information from a file) will automatically read the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you must provide the molecular structure yourself, i.e. you must set the `atoms` attribute to an `ichor.core.atoms.Atoms` instance, which contains the molecular structure. Otherwise, you will not be able to write the file to disk (and will also not be a correct ORCA input file because ORCA needs an input structure)."
